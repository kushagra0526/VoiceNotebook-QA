# VoiceNotebook-QA
This project is a Voice-Based Notebook Application that allows users to record spoken notes, store them using local storage, and later retrieve information by asking questions or searching keywords. It also includes a document section where users can upload documents, deploy them, and search for relevant content inside those documents.
